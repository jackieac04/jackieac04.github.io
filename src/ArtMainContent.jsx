                    Before begininng my undergraduate degree at Brown University, I was a <a href='https://www.dreyfoosptso.org/visual-arts'>visual arts student at Alexander W. Dreyfoos School of the Arts in West Palm Beach, Florida. </a>
                    It was at Dreyfoos and in the years preceeding that I began to take art seriously, both as a passion and potential career, surrounded by the enriching atmosphere of the students and teachers who frequented Building 9.

                    <br/>
                    Throughout my artistic journey I have experimented with a variety of media from watercolor to graphic design to mural painting, in an effort to best express my love for my subjects- people and nature that I find beautiful and often 
                    underappreciated- in the most vibrant colors and atmospheres.
                    I typically combine this love with a central figure in an expression of emotion turned literal, with the heart frequently placed outside of the body.
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                    In my art, I strive to recreate the wonder I feel every day by simply being alive, and I hope that as you look through my art, you're reminded of the things you cherish too :)
