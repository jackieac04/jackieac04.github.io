        Although my cs journey started quite recently compared to my artistic one, I have many interests that I'm exploring.
        I'm drawn to the visual side of computer science- web development, UI/UX design, graphics â€“ anything that combines the logic of coding with visual creativity resonates with me. 
        I'm also interested in how we can make technology both functional and aesthetically pleasing and user-friendly.

        After the end of freshman year, I began as a research assistant at <a href="https://sites.brown.edu/bltlab/">The Brown Language and Thought Lab</a> under <a href="https://www.gaborbrody.com/">Gabor Brody</a>. 
        I love working on projects that are used to help people and further our knowledge of the mind!

        <br />
        When I'm not coding or painting you'll probably find me exploring my surroundings or collecting little <a href="https://www.instagram.com/birbsatbrown/">birbs</a> or other trinkets, which is why I'm currntly woking on
        <a href='/cs/poster'>The Brown Poster Archive</a>, in an attempt to catalog and document the history of student events, priorities, and design choices over time at Brown. 
        <br />
        <br />
        Heading into sophomore year and the rest of college, I'm so excited to see what more I'll learn, in my courses and also as a Teaching Assistant for <a href="https://cs.brown.edu/courses/cs015/">CS 15</a> this fall.
        Thanks for reading! Check out some recent projects I've been working on below :)
