        <h1>About my Work</h1>
        <p className='cs-text'> Unlike art, I didn't begin coding until fairly recently, Spring 2022, to be more specific.
        In high school I was focused on my art practice, and we didn't have much in the way of stem resources
        or any computer science related courses until my senior year.
        <br />
        <br />
        Because I had such little exposure to it, I really didn't know anything about the subject, at all. But as I was
        <a href="https://bulletin.brown.edu/the-college/concentrations/">the many undergrad concentrations one could choose at Brown</a>, I discovered why Computer Science is undoubtedly 
        the most popular concentration for undergrads here.
        <br />
        <br />
        I've always loved math and science and its applications, and I realized quickly by looking through the <a href="https://bulletin.brown.edu/the-college/concentrations/comp/">Course Catalog</a> that 
        I had been mistaken before. So many classes looked interesting (most of which I have yet to take)- from Graphics to Computer Vision,
        topics that bridged the gap between my many interdisciplinary interests. 
        <br />
        <br />
        And so, hesitantly, I began my coding journey.
        <br />
        <br />
        Entering freshman year, I was scared of what was ahead. I had learned some fundamentals over the summer to prepare, 
        but the little had truly understood was no match for the pacing of the curriculum, from the perspective of someone who knew almost nothing like I did.
        But needless to say, I loved it. I loved making silly little games in <a href="https://cs.brown.edu/courses/cs015/">CS 15</a> and I even loved how satisfying it felt to finish completely non-visual projects in <a href="https://brown-csci0200.github.io/">CS 200</a>. 
        And as the months went on, I began to spend less time in office hours and more time making things and really understanding how to use the concepts I had learned.
        <br />
        <br />
        After the end of freshman year, I began as a research assistant at <a href="https://sites.brown.edu/bltlab/">The Brown Language and Thought Lab</a>. And although I had never worked in JavaScript before or on web apps,
        working on projects that would actually be used to help people was so rewarding. 
        <br />
        <br />
        Heading into sophomore year and the rest of college, I'm so excited to see what more I'll learn, in my courses and also as a Teaching Assistant for CS 15.
        Thanks for reading! Check out some recent projects I've been working on above :)
